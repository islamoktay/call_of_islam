### How system works

Application is going to need location of users to detect exact prayer times. Unfortunately if device does not have sensors it will not work.
Call Of Islam also needs location for compass page to find qibla direction.
You will be called by the most beautiful adhan sound. The beautiful voice of Nasser Al Qatami will be with you for five times a day.
There will be other features inshaAllah.
