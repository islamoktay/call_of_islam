### How system works\

🤓 Application is going to need location of users to detect exact prayer times. Unfortunately if device does not have sensors it will not work.\
🎯 Call Of Islam also needs location for compass page to find qibla direction.\
🎼 You will be called by the most beautiful adhan sound. The beautiful voice of Nasser Al Qatami will be with you for five times a day.\
🎨 There will be other features inshaAllah.\
